To build you need the following modules

Cherrypy 3.2.3

Django 1.6.5

pyinstaller 2.1



From the main directory where "serve.py" lives run: pyinstaller -D serve.spec

This will generate a "build" directory (you can delete this) and a "dist" directory where you will find the "serve" directory. Inside you will find you executable. Create a short-cut and put it wherever.
